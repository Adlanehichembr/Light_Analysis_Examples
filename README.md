# Light_Analysis_Examples
Software examples for Thorlabs' products that are used to measure light (e.g. Spectrometers, Wafefront Sensors, etc.)

## Repo Organization
All examples are split up by programming language and product type. Directions on using specific examples are given within the folders.


### Python Requirements

Python examples make use of the Ctypes module, which can be installed using the command

```
pip install ctypes
```

if cytypes is not installed already.
