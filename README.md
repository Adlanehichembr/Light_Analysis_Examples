# Light_Analysis_Examples

## Repo Organization
All examples are split up by programming language and product type. Directions on using specific examples are given within the folders.


### Python Requirements

Python examples make use of the ctypes module, which can be installed using the command

```
pip install ctypes
```

if ctypes is not installed already.
