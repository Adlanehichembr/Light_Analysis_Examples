## Included Examples

### Thorlabs CCS Spectrometer Open and Read
These sample codes show how you can control a Thorlabs CCS spectrometer in Python.
They uses the ctypes library to load the DLL file for these spectrometers and the Matplotlib library to plot the measured spectrum. These libraries need to be installed separately on the computer.

Please note that the resource name (“USB0::0x1313::…”) in the sample code needs to be adjusted to the used spectrometer type and unit.
