## Included Example

### WFS_Matlab
This example shows how to initialize the wavefront sensor and configure the attached microlens array. This also goes through the suggested process for acquiring spotfield images and outputting calculation data like centroid and wavefront values. 

The code uses the C library DLL file for the Wavefront Sensor.
